# CovidVremenar
This app was created for a class Terminalske naprave in uporabniški vmesniki at Faculty of electrical engineering by Eva Vidmar and Matjaž Bevc. We got the highest grade for the app. 

The main solution it focuses on is to display data about Covid - 19 pandemic in Slovenia on easy and fun innovative way. It allows user to choose the Region in which they live and then it displays
the data about the number of all people in the selected region, number of active cases, and new cases affected with Covid - 19. If the number of active cases is increasing the
picture of the weather shown is rainy as shown in the picture below:

In other case if the number of active cases is decreasing the image of the weather is sunny as shown below:

)

If the user lets the app to use the data about his location the region can also be chosen automatically. 

For the data we used REST Api by Slovenian page Covid Sledilnik. 

The app was programmed in Android Studio with the use of Github. The user interface was first designed in Adobe XD.
